# Traffic Camera Optimization

Traffic Intersection Camera Optimization

 - Solved the problem of installing minimum possible cameras at intersection of streets using Python and C++.

 - Used Multithreading and Inter Processor Communication (IPC) to efficiently distribute work among different process and facilitate communication.

 - Implemented an approximate algorithm for the Vertex Cover problem to find vertex for installation of security cameras at traffic intersections.

 - Computed the approximation ratio between the MiniSAT solver and the approximation algorithms and presented a comparative study documenting the trade-offs in running time and accuracy
